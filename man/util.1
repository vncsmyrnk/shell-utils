.SH DESCRIPTION
.B util
is a shell-agnostic utility tool designed to make your scripts accessible everywhere using the `util` command.

The command accepts a name argument, representing the script to execute from `$HOME/.config/util/scripts`. Any additional arguments are seamlessly passed to the specified script.

Setup scripts for third-party applications are located in the utils folder. You can add your own by placing them in `$HOME/.config/util/setup`. Calling the setup script in your shell configuration result in the files at `$HOME/.config/util/setup` being automatically loaded.

Custom completions can be set as comments after a `# Completions` comment header. See `$HOME/.config/util/scripts/locale/gettext.sh` for reference.

Help sections can be added as a text after a comment `# help: `. See `$HOME/.config/util/scripts/update.sh` for reference.
