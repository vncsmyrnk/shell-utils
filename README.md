# shell-utils üõ†Ô∏è

Have you ever struggled to locate useful scripts scattered across multiple files when you need them the most? **shell utils** is a shell-agnostic utility tool designed to make your scripts accessible everywhere using the `util` command.

Do you also maintain various run command files for setting up aliases, environment variables, and shell plugins? **shell utils** includes a configuration script that automatically sources all your essential configurations.

Do you manually install apps and maintain scripts to update them? with **shell utils**, you can configure your scripts to run automatically whenever `util update` is executed, streamlining all your update tasks.

## Usage

```sh
util update # this will execute an script named update.sh
            # in your $HOME/.config/util/scripts directory

util git checkout-pr # this will execute an script named checkout-pr.sh
                     # in your $HOME/.config/util/git directory

util git # considering a `checkout-pr.*` script exists in the directory
         # a "commands available" section will be displayed. A comment
         # starting with "help" will be printed if present on the script
```

The `util` command accepts a name argument, representing the script to execute from `$HOME/.config/util/scripts`. Any additional arguments are seamlessly passed to the specified script.

```sh
\. <(util cat setup-zsh)       # sources rc files at `$HOME/.config/util/setup` for zsh
\. <(util cat completions-zsh) # adds completions for the util command for zsh
                               # to make it persistent, add this commands to your `$HOME/.zshrc`
```

For more information: `$ man util`.

### Customization

This project includes [default scripts](https://github.com/vncsmyrnk/shell-utils/tree/main/defaults), but you can easily add custom scripts by placing them in `$HOME/.config/util/scripts`. Subfolders within this directory represent subcommands for the `util` command.

Similarly, setup scripts for third-party applications are located in the [utils folder](https://github.com/vncsmyrnk/shell-utils/tree/main/utils). You can add your own by placing them in `$HOME/.config/util/setup`.

To automate update tasks when running `util update`, simply place your scripts in `$HOME/.config/util/scripts/on-update`.

> [!TIP]
> The best practice is to keep your scripts were you already store them and just create symbolic links (stow is a great tool for that) in the folders `$HOME/.config/util/scripts` and `$HOME/.config/util/setup`.

### Development

**shell-utils** is built on the principle of simplicity, ensuring that it remains lightweight and easy to use. The project avoids unnecessary complexity by leveraging tools that are commonly available on most unix-like systems, such as `sh`, `grep`, `sed`, and `find`.

## Install

```sh
git clone git@github.com:vncsmyrnk/shell-utils.git
